    "A restaurant is a business which prepares and serves food and drink to customers in return for money, either paid before and after the meal. The City of New York is famous for its excellent cuisine. Its food culture includes an array of international cuisines influenced by the city’s immigrant history.\n",
    "  1.\tCentral and Eastern European immigrants, especially Jewish immigrants         – bagels, cheesecake, hot dogs, knishes and delicatessens.\n",

    "  8.\tUntapped markets\n",
    "  9.\tSaturated markets etc\n",
    "  10.\tAlso, consider different types of varieties of cuisine can be prepared.\n",
